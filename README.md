# UCreate - Creative Networking App

My idea behind UCreate was to build a platform for creatives of all fields to network, find a community, and share what they're passionate about. It started when I took a User Experience Design course through <a href = "https://ecornell.cornell.edu/certificates/technology/user-experience-design/" targer="_blank">eCornell</a> from August 2021 to January 2022.

I went through the whole process of researching, conducting surveys, and analyzing the data to have a true understanding of my user group. 

I didn't want to stop there, so after using Figma to design a mockup of the application, I used my training from <a href="https://yearup.widen.net/s/fqm66ncbmv/pluralsight-case-study" target="_blank">Year Up/Pluralsight's Learn to Code Academy</a>, to start building with JavaScript.

My strength has been in frontend design, so I challenged myself to learn backend with the technologies MySql and Node.js so I could create a fullstack application.

My hope is that as I grow as a developer, I can optimize this application's code and security so that I can actually put it out as a working platform for widescale use.
